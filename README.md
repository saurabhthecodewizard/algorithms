# Hi, I'm Saurabh! ðŸ‘‹


# Algorithms By Princeton

https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1

https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2

This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.
All the features of this course are available for free.  It does not offer a certificate upon completion.
